\usage{
Check_ROI_Codes(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class dataframe as output directly from SizeExtractR::Build_Uncalibrated_Dataset()}
}
\value{
Runs through interactive checks for the user to determine if the ROI Codes (i.e., main type of each object i.e. Calibration point, calibration length or ROI of interest) used in their image analysis are correct, and help to identify any images that had mistakes in the labelling process. If mistakes are found support information is given to the user.

Also returns a character string reading "success", which is not used in further SizeExtractR functions.
