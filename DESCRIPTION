Title: Extracts object size metrics from scaled images analysed in SizeExtractR ImageJ protocols
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Liam", "Lachs", email = "liamlachs@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The ImageJ tools and protocol serve to optimise the slow task of manually outlining objects from sets of images. A scale is required within each image. These tools can save considerable time, and are a great option for image analysis applications that are not suited to machine-learning or other automated outlining classifiers.
    Measures of size that are captured using SizeExtractR tools include 2D area, minimum and maximum diameter, estimated spherical and elliptical volume, bounding boxes.
